  A Trace is a process that collects spans. When a span
  is created it registers with the process and when it is closed
  it removes itself from the process and gets sent
  to the reporter that is has been configured for. A Trace can be configured
  to act differently based on need. This allows you to create some traces
  that get sent to Jaeger, and other that get logged or sent to null.
  You can even configure the port numbers for your collectors so Traces
  can go to different collectors.
